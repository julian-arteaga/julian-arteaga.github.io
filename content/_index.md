# About me


I am an Extended Term Consultant in World Bank's Development Research Group (DECRG). I study development economics, and my research focuses on agricultural land and labor markets, agricultural productivity, migration, and on the way rural households mitigate risk.

I earned my Ph.D. in Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California, Davis. Before that I received an MA and a BA in Economics from Universidad de los Andes in Bogot√°, Colombia.

# About me


I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Agricultural and Resource Economics department at the University of California, Davis. I study development economics, and my research focuses on agricultural land and labor markets, agricultural productivity, migration, and on how rural households mitigate risk.


Before starting my Ph.D. I received an MA and a BA in Economics from Universidad de los Andes in Bogot√°, Colombia.

I am on the job market during the 2023-24 academic year. You can reach me at jgarteaga@ucdavis.edu

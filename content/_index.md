# About me


I am an Economics Consultant at the Vice Presidency for Sectors and Knowledge (VPS) of the Inter-American Development Bank. I study development economics, with a focus on agricultural land and labor markets, agricultural productivity, migration, and household risk mitigation.

I received a Ph.D. in Agricultural and Resource Economics from the University of California, Davis. Before that, I received an MA and a BA in Economics from Universidad de los Andes in Bogot√°, Colombia.

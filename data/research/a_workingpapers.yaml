    I estimate how the imposition of municipality-specific restrictions on rural land markets impacts productivity, land concentration, and agricultural labor outcomes in Colombia. Using a newly built dataset and exploiting variation in land ownership ceilings across bordering municipalities, I find that municipalities with more stringent restrictions experienced a permanent reduction in agricultural revenue per hectare, accompanied by minimal reductions in overall land inequality. However, restrictions also increased agricultural workers’ earnings and the share of workers employed in agriculture. I further show that the average negative effects on productivity are heterogeneous and depend on the degree of pre-reform land concentration in each municipality. These results are in line with an economy where producers have market power in agricultural input markets, and where the implementation of sales restrictions curbs market power effects but also introduces other type of distortions. To formalize this intuition, I develop a general-equilibrium model of agricultural production in which large landholders exert market power in both land and labor markets, while the government imposes limits on land accumulation. The model’s predictions are consistent with both the estimated effects and with the observed long-run patterns of persistent land concentration in the economy.

    Geographic mobility is a key component of labor supply elasticity. We document a reversal in the relative migration elasticity of Mexican immigrants in the U.S. relative to native-born workers. In 2000--2012, Mexican immigrants' location choice was more responsive to local economic conditions, with the gap expanding over the period. This pattern subsequently reversed, and by 2020 native-born workers had a greater migration elasticity than their Mexican-born counterparts. This reversal is unique to immigrants of Mexican origin, does not correspond to geographic differences in immigration policy, and is not explained by the occupational or demographic composition of the Mexican-born labor force.

    The novel insurance contracts for crop losses and livestock mortality that have been developed in low income countries typically protect against shocks in the male sphere of economic activity. Often overlooked are women, the particularities of their indirect exposure to this risk, and their socially constructed responsibility to manage family well-being. To fill this lacuna, this paper studies the effect of a low-cost intervention that reformulates a livestock insurance contract so that it directly addresses women’s risk and is sold in units that are commensurate with women’s expenditure responsibilities. We measure the effect of this contractual reformulation using a randomized trial amongst pastoralist communities in Kenya. Twenty-four percent of previously subsidized households that received the novel contractual formulation purchased insurance (without subsidy), compared to only 13% of previously subsidized households offered insurance under the standard male-risk formulation. Households that had not received prior insurance subsidies purchased no insurance, irrespective of the framing. Protecting women, their assets and those who depend on them will require a combination of smart subsidies and gender-intentional insurance contract design.

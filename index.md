I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Agricultural and Resource Economics department at the University of California, Davis. I study development economics, and my research focuses on agricultural land and labor markets, agricultural productivity, migration, and on how rural households mitigate risk.

Before starting my Ph.D. I received an MA and a BA in Economics from Universidad de los Andes.

## Teaching Assistant

In Winter of 2019, I was a teaching assistant for the class ARE172 “Financial Management of the Firm”. In student evaluations, I was commended for being approachable (5/5), organized (5/5), and for helping students understand course concepts (5/5). See student evaluation [summary](../assets/summary.pdf) and [comments](../assets/comments.pdf).
